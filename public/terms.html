                without prior written approval: <br>
                Government agencies; <br>
                Search engines; <br>
                News organizations; <br>
                Online directory distributors when they list us in the directory may link to our Web site in the same
                manner as they hyperlink to the Web sites of other listed businesses; and <br>
                Systemwide Accredited Businesses except soliciting non-profit organizations, charity shopping malls, and
                charity fundraising groups which may not hyperlink to our Web site. <br><br>
                These organizations may link to our home page, to publications or to other Web site information so long
                as the link: (a) is not in any way misleading; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement or
                approval of the linking party and its products or services; and (c) fits within the context of the
                linking party's site. <br>
                We may consider and approve in our sole discretion other link requests from the following types of
                organizations: <br>
                commonly-known consumer and/or business information sources such as Chambers of Commerce, American

                dot.com community sites; <br>
                associations or other groups representing charities, including charity giving sites, <br>

                reflect unfavorably on us or our accredited businesses (for example, trade associations or other
                organizations representing inherently suspect types of business, such as work-at-home opportunities,
                shall not be allowed to link); (b)the organization does not have an unsatisfactory record with us; (c)
                the benefit to us from the visibility associated with the hyperlink outweighs the absence of PODtomatic
                Company; and (d) where the link is in the context of general resource information or is otherwise
                consistent with editorial content in a newsletter or similar product furthering the mission of the
